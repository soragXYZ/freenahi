	"Amortizable loan explanation": "A repayable loan is a loan whose repayment is spread out over time and broken down into several monthly installments.\nOn the surface, the payments do not vary. In other words, the borrower repays the same amount each month.\nHowever, the portion of interest charged by the financial institution decreases over time, while the portion allocated to the capital gradually increases.\n\nIt is the most common type of loan in France.",
