!!! warning "Issues, discussions, and comments are forever"

    Please note that everything you write is permanent and will remain for everyone to read â€“ forever.  
    Therefore, please always be nice and constructive.

### Before creating an issue

- Have you checked if a similar bug report or change request has already been
  created, or have you stumbled upon something that might be related?

- Did you fill out every field as requested and did you provide all additional
  information we maintainers need to comprehend your request?

### Before asking a question

- Is there an open discussion on the topic of your request? If the answer is yes,
  does your question match the direction of the discussion, or should you open a
  new discussion?

- Did your provide our community with all the necessary information to
  understand your question and help you quickly, or can you make it easier to
  help you?

### Before commenting

## Rights and responsibilities

reject, or edit issues, discussions, comments, commits, and to block users who
__do not align__ with our contribution guidelines.  
This role requires us to be actively involved in maintaining the integrity and
positive atmosphere of our community. Upholding these standards decisively
ensures a respectful and inclusive environment for all members.
