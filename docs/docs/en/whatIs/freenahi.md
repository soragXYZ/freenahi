# What is Freenahi ?

Freenahi is an app that helps you better manage your money.  
Track all your assets, manage your budget, optimize your investments, and take action.

Freenahi was built with the idea that if you have multiple banking accounts, 
with multiple investments, it becomes quite tedious to follow everything.  

Of course you can use Excel with Google finance shenanigans, but it does not 
allow you to follow your bank account and transactions in real time.

Last but not least, Freenahi is free, opensource and supposed to be run locally, 
because we think that your banking data should stay private and under your control.

In order to connect to your banking account, we are using the [Powens API](powens.md)

???+ warning
    Freenahi does not have access to your credentials, they are stored by the third-party account aggregator Powens
